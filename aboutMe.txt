I am a self-taught Front-End Web Developer. Spending most of the quarantine time (10 months) in USA by myself taught me how to stand on myfoot. By looking to the life from different angles, I finally found my passion with skiing and coding. Having worked with different types of groups such as project teams, nongovernmental organizations and workplaces, improved my communicationand organization skills, provide different aspects and made me fluentin English. I code on CSS3 with Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES5, ES6), and currently working on angular.
