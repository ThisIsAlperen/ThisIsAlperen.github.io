This is my first game experience with JavaScript.
                                It has different 'if' for every winnign situation. After every win or loose, saves the
                                score to the Local Storage. There are two different function for game process; one and
                                two (as players). In case of choosing one, the game choose avalible places by randomly
                                or a few extras depends on the level. In case of choosing two, game will allow to click
                                anytime.
