This is my lastes game project. I tried to use the
                                Object Oriented Programming for some parts. Main thing in this project is the design and
                                appearence. Adobe Photoshop is highly used. Animation effects highlighted. The most of
                                the functions run to show or hide an object. No extra algoritm. The question list held
                                at minimum. Keyboard, question and the answer will be created after chosing a category.
                                They will be deleted at the end of the round.
